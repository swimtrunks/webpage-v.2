# my personal site: malcolmpeterson.com

(this is a rough readme that will grow in time. I just wanted to get something in here as I work through cleaning up the code and documenting things for later)

This is my own personal website, built with SvelteKit. It also holds my own personal blog.

I wanted to build something with SvelteKit as it had just reached its v1 release. I had sometime off so I figured I would rebuild my personal site with it

# What Else...

As stated before, this is built with SvelteKit v1, and as this code is now, there is much to clean up, but the site is good enough to deploy in this state (and i was getting impatient) so I went ahead and hosted it over at Netlify.

To run it locally:

```shell
# First, install dependencies
npm install
# Then, run it on dev mode
npm run dev
```

The site should now be up on http://localhost:5173/ (http://0.0.0.0:5173/) on your local machine.

# What's Next?

Right now, im in the process of optimizing images and reconfiguring styling to be easier to read / more performant. I will also be adding a new branch as a starter kit for SvelteKit in the future so that folks can just pull it down and run with it, avoiding any other headaches that can come along with learning something new.

I will say that building with SvelteKit has been great and pretty fun so far, so those how are new to Svelte or those coming from React or something wouldnt take much to get up and running themselves.
