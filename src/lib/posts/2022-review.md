## This year has been fulfilling …and weird.

### First and most importantly:

Tori and I got married... for the second time.

### Other stuff:

I got into mechanical keyboards and started on my journey to optimize my ideal workspace.

Meanwhile professionally, I completed my first full year working at Postlight as a software engineer. Wrote some articles, built this site(link) (among other things), visited NY (for the first time) for work… and didn’t hate it.

### Looking ahead:

In 2023 I want to continue becoming the best version of myself as I can. Collectively I hope that we can learn from our mistakes and reflect on our choices so we can make better ones in the future.

## Protect Black Women.
## Trans Lives Matter.
