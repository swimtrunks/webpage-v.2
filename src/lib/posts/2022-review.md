excerpt: A look back at 2022 and what's next for 2023.

## This year has been fulfilling …and weird but most importantly:

### Tori and I got married...

(i guess you could say lupin was my best boy)

### for the second time.

 ( i think we will skip a third wedding in 2023 )
### Other stuff:

I finally dove deep into the mechanical keyboards rabbit hole, got back into music production, amateur photography and started on my journey to optimize my ideal workspace.

Meanwhile professionally, I completed my first full year working at Postlight as a software engineer. Wrote some articles, [built this site](./sveltekit-website-redesign) (among other things), visited New York for the first time (for work) … and didn’t hate it.

### Looking ahead:

In 2023 I want to continue becoming the best version of myself as I can. Collectively I hope that we can learn from our mistakes and reflect on our choices so we can make better ones in the future.

## Protect Black Women.
## Trans Lives Matter.
