## So..

I haven't gotten around to writing this one yet, but I WILL as soon as I get the site fully built. I want to put all the roadblocks and dumb mistakes in there for folks like myself to read in the future so they can avoid the headaches. 

That being said, Svelte is pretty neat and working with it has been been ...fun(??) BUT since the v.1 changes are still so new there aren't very many guides out there for it so I want to take my time with this one (I have already started writing so don't worry).

### Thanks
