## Year end lists are tough...

There is never a shortage of music (or year end lists for that matter), but as time has gone on I have found that folks will post their definitive year end list earlier and earlier each year. I think the first one i saw was mid November in 2022! One thing that I have found solace in is that with my ever growing love for musical discovery there are so many releases added to the proverbial pile throughout the year. This year I found myself cataloguing my musical taste in a more programmatic and descriptive way.

### The great Spotify migration

As I said before I started looking the way that I was catalouging my music tastes throughout the year and found that I was relying far too much on spotify to do that work for me with its Spotify Wrapped feature. This feature is great but what if I listened to music off the app? What if I listened to the radio, or a tape or a record or...you get it. 
### 1. The Top Album - Artist

<p>
I feel like I had to pick a "best" album of the year so I choose this but if im being honest this top spot flucuates by the moment. So right now, this one just feels right. The jazzy and percussion and smooth tones really carry this album throughout. I had to make it my top album due to the fact that I feel like I suggested this to the most people this year and it (IMO) is criminally underrated. My alternative motive in giving this a top spot is also because it didn't really  make most lists I have come across at all! So i felt the need to spread the gospel a little more.
