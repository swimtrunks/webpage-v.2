## GameCenter CX

**So this isn't actually a video game but** for me this needed to be included in my year end list. 2022 was the first time I heard of GameCenter CX, and I have been changed forever. It airs in Japan on Fuji TV and has been doing so since 2003 (hey even have a movie or two). 

The show revolves around the president of a fictional company (played by Shinya Arino) where his sole task is to complete video games (in some cases he gives up or gets help from his crew but still…) and he isn’t particularly a "amazing" when it comes to playing them. This ultimately results in 12hr long play sessions sometimes spanning days at a time. It can be a great ordeal for him to actually get past one level let alone the whole game in one sitting, but there are moments where the tension is high and he somehow does some incredible manueveur or has some wild stroke of luck to complete an ordeal. 

Seeing him get so excited, and the crew cheering and screaming tips for him from behind the camera, adds even more charm to the show. It does have its pitfalls and some poorly aged bits but even with this I would suggest it to just about anyone. **KACHO ON!**

## And now the games:

## Vampire Survivors

**When I first came across this game I immediately discounted it as a meme.** I actually just started to play it last month and I can confirm it is a meme, **BUT** it is also an amazing game. So much so that if **I absolutely had to choose a game of the year...this would be it**. 

You move your character around the screen and pick new abilities as you defeat enemies. Notice how I DID NOT say that you attack enemies, that is because the character attacks on their own. This continues until you get a game over...then you boot it up again. 

Thats it. Thats the game.

The game is purposefully broken and it is super easy to pick up and play for minutes at a time. The drip feed of abilities, unlockables and features really does hook you after a few play sessions. I can stress how incrediblely addictive it can be, I have lost hours to this game. After a few runs you develop new strategies, find new powers and spells, and you fill the screen with massive attacks all the while gaining more experience, more gold. One of the tag lines for the game is "Be the Bullet Hell" and I think that wraps it up perfectly.

It’s under 10 bucks, on everything but PlayStation and Switch (yes that means it’s on mobile too), just buy it already.

## Tunic

**The charm of this game is really what sold me on it but** the gameplay is fun and solid in its own right. The voxel art style really speaks to me and the fact that you get an in-game game manual that reveals mechanics that you can use in game really is just the icing on the cake. Each page of the manual is detailed just as it would be if you were to pull out an old SNES booklet, complete with dot matrix art and hand scribbled notes. It is written in a language that you sometimes won't be able to parse but as the game goes on you will slow come to understand through context. The manual is incomplete at the start of the game and you have to find the missing pages throughout your time playing, but the cool thing to me is that it doesn't mean you can’t execute any of the moves or access any of the secrets without the pages themselves.

<Image text="I mean just look at how gorgeous this is!" image="images/2022/video-games/tunic-manual.jpg" alttext="screenshot of in game manual of tunic, explaining how resources like health and magic works, page 11" />

The game is so cute, but also deceptively challenging. It is on Xbox Game Pass, **but If the phrase "Zelda but with a fox" resonates with you at all**, go on and pick this one up.

## Cult of the lamb

**Speaking of cute games**, "Cult of the Lamb" on the surface allows you to play as a cute little lamb (so cute!) 

...but moments later that gets killed and a dark lord returns you to land of the living to get shared revenge on their behalf on the enemies that killed you and also imprisoned it (still cute...right?).

 The game is split into to halves, farm management ala "Stardew Valley" and hack and slash levels. This lended itself really well to co-op with my wife as I would play the combat bits while she would manage the farm / cult. I would say that I drew the short end of the stick as the fighting isn’t particularly interesting or responsive (at least in my opinion) but it really does come alive in its presentation and the farm sim and cult management sections. 
 
 You gain powers, upgrade your farm, conduct sermons and rituals, rescue followers in the wild to see them come and (get killed/ sacrificed, reeducated, or resurrected as some ghoul) go.

## Signalis

**Growing upI wasn’t really too into the "Resident Evil" or "Parasite Eve" series but**  as I grew older I would come to appreciate them. One night I was watching a friend stream before bed and they were playing this game that mirrored those games of the past. That game was Signalis. I feel it really slipped under my radar this year as I haven't really seen too much press around it either but that is a shame because it is amazing. 

The game is a survival horror with lots of puzzles, locked doors and resources to horde. You also can only carry 6 items at a time so you are constantly juggling inventory in order to navigate the map and solve puzzles. There have been times where I didnt even carry a gun because I needed to make a run around the map in order to grab items I came across earlier. The combat is fair and I haven't really encountered too many situations where I have run out of resources to the point where I could not bounce back but thats what the higher difficulty is for. 

After you beat the game you can play on its "hard" difficulty: less health and resources and more aggressive enemies…if that speaks to you then go for it but I have really enjoyed my time with this game on its original settings. It even comes with a decent CRT filter complete with that odd light bloom and traces. **Among all the games on this list I would say this would be the one that I would / have been suggesting to everyone.** Rose Engine really did a great job and I hope that more people experience what they have done with Signalis.

## Shredder's Revenge

**As a kid I was a huge turtles fan and as an adult** am still a huge turtles fan (the newest animated series is vastly underrated, and the newest movie centered around it is great). We have been overdue for a good turtles game and luckily the folks and DotEmu delivered with "Shredder's Revenge". It’s greatly reminiscent of old 90s beat em ups (ie: "Turtles in Time") but with updated visuals, and co-op with up to 6 players. I am huge dork that has always had a soft spot for Leonardo but each character has their own set of moves, taunts and personality that shines each time you play one. 

I have played through this game 2 times already and played online with a group of friends and I would love to have another excuse to play it again.

## God of War - Ragnorok

![God of War screenshot](images/2022/video-games/gowR.png)

**I have been a fan of these games since the original** but something about the journey from those to the reboot of the series makes it special. When I picked up the 2019 "God of War" my wife was hooked on the story. A father grieving the loss of his wife, and also trying to be the best father he can be to his son while preparing him for the harsh landscape they find themselves in. Once we found out the next was announced I knew I would it would be a day one purchase and after playing through the story (along with quite a few of the side quests) I am happy to say it did not dissapoint.

 As someone who is seeking to become a father sooner rather than later this game really did hit a cord with me. There was one moment when Kratos was speaking with another character about how they needed to be better fathers for their children and my wife and I looked at one another and I said **“When did this game become about healing generational trauma!?”**.
 
 Of course the story, acting, and music are hitting on all cylinders as well but what is there to say about the gameplay? It’s more of the same honestly…but thats not a bad thing. The combat was smooth and felt great in the first game so they didnt really need to change much here in my opinion. **Seeing Kratos evolve from an angry yelling man hellbent on revenge at any cost from the original franchise starting on the PS2, to a father battling to better himself so that he may provide his son with the support and love he never had growing up…** that's GROWTH.

### Honorable Mentions:

### Elden Ring


**Ok, so hear me out...** FromSoftware games really upset me, but I think it's because of the fanbase. I have heard "gitgud" so many times so you will have to forgive me for biases and whenever I hear that a game is “fair” I think about how thats not what “fair” actually means, because I always hear folks say this whenever they talk about "Elden Ring". I will say, aside from all this, **I have actually had a good time playing it**. It (along with any other FromSoftware game I have picked up) really forces you to play by its own rules. The folks you see playing this on dance pads or 1v1-ing each boss with no damage are the players who have internalized those rules and know just how to bend them…I unfortunately have not reached that level yet. I played this game for about 4 days and never beat Margit but I know that I will find myself playing it again in the near future.

### Fortnite (finally)

I finally played fornite in 2022, and I think I understand why it’s so popular. Playing with friends has been great and seeing Goku shoot at a hot dog while Arianna grande and doom guy charge up an deku smash….is as ridiculous as it sounds.

### Disco Elysium

Weird game that had me from the moment I failed a skill check to “skip out on my tab”. I have to take notes while playing and it does ask a lot from it players but the pay off is a great game that really gives more than I ever expected.

### Snowrunners

My nephew brought this game to my attention and I havent picked up yet but a game where you can explore, wreck your vehicle, recover that vehicle and then find a more creative way to get from point a to point b…im in. It’s also on gamepass so it’s a no brainer.

### NFS Unbound

The game’s story and acting are cringey, there’s quite a few pitfalls when it comes to the way it handles difficulty ( having to have a certain amount of money / cars of a particular rank for the race at the end of each in game week, terrible rubberbanding, etc) but I saw this game through to the end and actually had fun with it. I love the look but wish they went all the way and gave us the burnout paradise/ auto modelesta hybrid we all deserve. I know this sounds like a mixed bag, because it is but i really did enjoy this game. I think the team is taking the franchise back in the right direction. Not worth full price in my eyes so maybe wait for a sale. On the other hand, it’s the only game where you can literally interview Rihanna baby daddy while driving, so there’s that.
