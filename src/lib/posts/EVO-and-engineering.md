## Secret's out...

**Learning how to program is tough**. It is like learning a new language (both literally and figuratively) due to the fact that there are a slew of new concepts, and terms to learn. When I originally approached this, I thought of it like school. Each day was filled with assignments, lectures (or youtube videos) and homework... which admittedly got boring quickly, until one day I stepped away from my computer and started a 2 hour long play session of Street Fighter V.
As someone who has played Street Fighter over its many iterations (to varying degrees of success), I can say that very few things can seem as impenetrable as the fighting games. Just try to explain to someone who hasn't played any video game in their life exactly how to actually pull off a dragon punch let alone some of the deeper strategies of the game. Everything sounds like nonsense if you aren't familiar : okizeme, turtling, EX, footsies, anti-air... Even the move list can look like hieroglyphics to the untrained eye.

This was the proper framing of growth for me. So I started to approach things much like I did fighting games. Not only did approach practice in a similar way, I was able to draw comparisons to common pitfalls in both, like anxiety when playing against others (pair programming & tech interviews), to why some characters are better or worse against other character matchups (why certain tools or programming languages are better suited for one project than another)

## Know your matchup

When first playing a fighting game, one of the most important decisions is often the first: What character will you play? Each character has their own strengths and weaknesses as they all have unique movesets, stats and quirks. Let’s use Ryu from Street Fighter as an example. He is a character that is a great all rounder with a simple yet diverse moveset. He has his iconic Hadouken (a special projectile attack that reaches across the screen) and decent normal attacks to keep your opponent guessing. A good matchup for him might be someone who likes to jump a lot or a player that wants to be close to you as much as possible but not all matchups with him are this favorable. 

Using this to frame an approach to a project we can think about these two simple questions: What are we trying to build and what trade offs are we going to encounter when deciding on what tooling and language/ framework we should use? Are you looking to build scripts for automation or you need to parse some data, maybe you are making a simple web scraper? In any of these cases you could pick up Python since it can excel with any of these use cases. Looking to do more work with the web, manipulate the DOM or want to pick a great language that can do things on both the backend and front end, then (in my opinion) Javascript would be a no brainer there. In either case you want to know exactly what each option's strengths and weaknesses are in correlation to what you seek to accomplish with any given project or app.
One issue I encountered when I started to learn how to program was what language would I learn first. 

Much like picking your first character in a fighting game you may find that some movesets can be easier to pick up than others and this rings true with programming as well. In either situation I would suggest that you pick a choice that resonates with you or you could choose something that lines up with something you would like to build for yourself and once you get one language under your belt it’ll be easier to learn others, so pick whatever is cool to you! If your choice resonates with you, you will be more apt to practice more, and the more you practice the better you will become. That leads me to…

## Practice and Implementation

Learning anything new will require consistent practice and both engineering and fighting games reward persistence over just about anything else but there's an inherent danger to practicing that I dont think is talked about enough that directly correlates to engineering as well.
Let's examine a scenario:

You have chosen what character you want to learn and you decide to jump into training mode to learn their moves and combos. So you get pretty good at nailing your moves against a training dummy. Your confidence is soaring! You decide to jump into a match online, and you lose…terribly. What happened!? You spent hours upon hours practicing, why didn't it translate into actually winning a match?

This is a common occurrence with fighting games and the cause is simple. You spent time learning moves but not how to execute them in an actual match against someone. Everything feels different when there is someone actively responding to your movements, alternately activating strategies to counteract your own. This doesn't mean you shouldnt practice at all but there is such a thing as diminishing returns. In order for that practice to fully pay off you must play against other players and gain experience in actually implementing and executing strategies and moves in real time.

In engineering you could easily fall into what is called “tutorial hell".This is where you would just sit in front of your code editor of choice and follow along word for word, line by line with a tutorial or video guiding you through building a program or app with relative ease, but when it comes to building your own project you wouldn't know where to start. It's all about putting the anxiety aside and actually applying the knowledge you gained from those tutorials and building your own applications. Without the tutorials you may miss out on great opportunities to learn new skills and gain new tools to build your own programs and applications but without building those projects on your own you would miss out on what exactly you lack and the crucial skill of understanding the problems that you seek to solve. I know it can be scary when you try to do something and run into a random error that you immediately know how to fix, or when you try to implement a new feature and it breaks your entire application, but its a lot like losing that first match. **With each failure you have a lesson on how you can overcome that scenario in the future so don’t let it discourage you from trying new things!**

## Take a break

Something that should be talked about more is the need to step away from a given problem after a while. I'm sure we have all had a bug or some hiccup with our tooling that has caused us to get halted in our tracks or you may hit a wall when you are trying to learn a new combo in a game, but then when you take a break something interesting can happen. You take a step away for a bit, go do something else and come back later on and then you fix the issue or land the combo easier than you had before. That’s because rest provides time for your mind to make strong connections among its neurons. This allows your mind to also subconsciously solve issues while you are off doing other things as well as making it easier to learn new things. Without this reset you are putting yourself at risk for burnout. So when you have spent a little too long staring at the same issue, just take a break and come at it fresh later (...and that's all the science I have for you in this article I promise).

## Conclusion

Engineering and fighting games at their core are just problem solving and when solving problems, the more you encounter, the more experience you have to draw on when utilizing the tools you have at your disposal. It is easy to stay motivated with every win but with every loss you have another opportunity to learn and adapt strategies to future scenarios. I still get nervous when joining a match against another player, just as I still have anxiety about trying a new approach or learning a new language but in keeping this mindset I know that growth will follow regardless of the outcome.
My hope is that this will not only lead a few programmers of all skill levels to a fresh perspective with approaching growth in the field, but maybe they will also want to learn how to properly execute a dragon punch as well.
